## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- HuggingFace Transformers
- PyTorch
- Google Gemini API key
- (Optional) SoundDevice and SciPy for voice recording functionality

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-aware-chatbot.git
cd emotion-aware-chatbot
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. (Optional) For voice recording support:
```bash
pip install sounddevice scipy
```

## Usage

1. Set up your Google Gemini API key:
   - Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file with your API key:
   ```toml
   GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
   ```
   - Alternatively, you can enter your API key directly in the app's sidebar

2. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run chatbot.py
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit (typically http://localhost:8501)

4. Start chatting! You can:
   - Type messages in the text input
   - Record voice messages (if supported)
   - Use quick expression buttons to share emotions

## API Keys

This application uses the Google Gemini API for generating responses and quotes. You'll need to:

1. Sign up for a Google Gemini API key at [https://ai.google.dev/](https://ai.google.dev/)
2. Add your API key to the app as described in the Usage section
3. Or add it in the .streamlit folder as secret.toml with GEMINI_API_KEY = '<API_KEY>'

## 🧠 How It Works

### Emotion Detection
- **Text Analysis**: Uses DistilRoBERTa-based model to classify emotions in text
- **Voice Analysis**: Employs wav2vec2 model to detect emotions from audio recordings

### Response Generation
- The detected emotion informs the prompt to Google's Gemini API
- Responses are tailored to be supportive and appropriate for the user's emotional state

### Quote Generation
- Inspirational quotes are generated based on the detected emotion
- Each quote is paired with an author attribution

## 🤖 Model Information

- **Text Emotion Detection**: [j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base](https://huggingface.co/j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base)
